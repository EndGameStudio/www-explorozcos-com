      <description>We are explorers, wonderers, and fun seekers.
 A long time ago, another lifetime it seems, Ciri and I lived in Germany while Ciri served as a Veterinary Technician in the Army. This part of our lives was tough but also very rewarding.
Because she helped with the Military Working Dogs, there were many late nights supporting the mission of her unit. On the other hand, we were in Europe!</description>
