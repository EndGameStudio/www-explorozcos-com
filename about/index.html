<p>A long time ago, another lifetime it seems, Ciri and I lived in Germany while Ciri served as a Veterinary Technician in the Army. This part of our lives was tough but also very rewarding.</p>
<p>Because she helped with the Military Working Dogs, there were many late nights supporting the mission of her unit. On the other hand, we were in Europe! Beautiful rich Europe! We visited Paris, Brussels, Munich, Barcelona, and more.</p>
<p>The point is <em>we explored</em>. But then we came back to the States and something beautiful happened, we had kids. For the past ten years, we worked hard to give them a rich life of experiences and fun and love. But we realized that we stopped <em>exploring</em>.</p>
<p>We're nearing our forties and we're not happy with the idea of just staying put and not experiencing the rest of the world. We want to also teach the kids the wonder of living outside your comfort zone, of finding fun things to do near and far, of <strong>exploring</strong>.</p>
<p>We've put things in motion to get back to exploring. We're prepping our home to sell this year. We're reducing our things. We're mentally preparing ourselves because we're going to full-time RV!</p>
<p>The plan will gain clarity as we continue to move but right now, it looks like a large fifth wheel RV, a dually pickup truck, and the entire North American continent. :)</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
