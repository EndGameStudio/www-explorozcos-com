We try to be a service-oriented family. Our life is full of blessings (or luck, whatever you like) and we try to pay that forward wherever and however we can.

Ciri received a call from grandma about making masks due to the nationwide shortage. Although grandma ended up having enough equipment and supplies, Ciri decided to jump in and do her part.

The kids, with their curiosity that is so beautiful (although sometimes, well, sometimes Mom and Dad just need a break!) asked Mom what she was up to.
