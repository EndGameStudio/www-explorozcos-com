## You received a mask that our little family made.

We hope it served you well. We can't imagine the difficulty you face but know that you are doing great. We all owe you a great debt and our eternal thanks.

We want to help the kids understand the impact of their efforts. If you wouldn't mind sending us a note with your mask. Please don't feel like you have to - you are appreciated whether you do or not. ❤️
