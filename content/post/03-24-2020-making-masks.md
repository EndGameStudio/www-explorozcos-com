We try to be a service-oriented family. Our life is full of blessings (or luck, whatever you like) and we try to pay that forward wherever and however we can.

Ciri received a call from grandma about making masks due to the nationwide shortage. Although grandma ended up having enough equipment and supplies, Ciri decided to jump in and do her part.

The kids, with their curiosity that is so beautiful (although sometimes, well, sometimes Mom and Dad just need a break!) asked Mom what she was up to.

Quickly, our dining table was overtaken with fabric, scissors, wire, elastic material, sewing machines, a laminator, a Cricut Maker, lots of Apple computing power and coffee.

It has become a family effort: learning to use a sewing machine; learning to cut wire, elastic, and more.

A lot has changed for our way of life and although some of it might go back to normal one day, much of it will not. Yet, the kids, so far, have been robust and curious. Don't get me wrong! It isn't easy! They're still kids with lots of energy and short attention spans. But they're really trying - they care. I can't ask for any better character trait in these kiddos than that.
