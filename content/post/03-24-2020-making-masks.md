Ciri received the call from grandma about making masks (due to the nationwide shortage). Although grandma ended up having enough equipment and supplies, Ciri decided to jump in and do her part.

Quickly, our dining table was overtaken with fabric, scissors, wire, elastic material, sewing machines, a laminator, a Cricut Maker, lots of Apple computing power and coffee.

The kids, with their curiosity that is so beautiful (although sometimes, well, _sometimes_ Mom and Dad just need a break!) asked Mom what she was up to.

It quickly became a family effort: learning to use a sewing machine; learning to cut fabric, wire, and elastic; and learning to put it all together.

A lot has changed for our way of life and although some of it might go back to normal one day, much of it will not. Yet, the kids, so far, have been robust and curious. Don't get me wrong! It isn't easy! They're still kids with lots of energy and short attention spans. But they're really trying - they care. I can't ask for any better character trait in these kiddos than that.
