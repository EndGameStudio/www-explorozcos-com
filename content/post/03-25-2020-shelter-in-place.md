We're doing our best to shelter in place during this epidemic. Luckily, we are mostly remote as it is anyway and we only go out for supplies and walks (while keeping within the CDC guidance of the 6-foot rule).

North Carolina Governor, Roy Cooper, ordered us all to stay home earlier this week. He's been recommending we stay home even before that. I work remotely and the kids are homeschooled, so it was easy for us to go on lockdown way back at the beginning of March.

## Supplies

Ciri has been making meal plans for a few years now. As far as grocery shopping goes, we are pretty efficient now. Ciri goes out every two weeks and comes back with a TON of food. Not much has changed for us except that we have to be a bit more creative with meals due to some shortages.

## Work

I am luckily still employed. Although our company has been affected by the economic downturn, I'm hopeful that we can weather the storm. We've got a good group of dedicated people.

## Schedule

The first week of this shutdown saw a lot of homeschooling schedules making rounds on social media. Again, since we've been homeschooling for years now, we already have a routine going. We started working on more walks around the neighborhood and other activities to help with cabin fever.

## Fun

I bought Pokemon Sword and pre-ordered Final Fantasy 7 Remake. That will buy us some time and help with bonding over some fun games.

This shelter-in-place has also caused a sharp growth in Pokemon Trading Cards as well. When the kids go above and beyond with their chores/routines, they earn a Pokemon TCG booster pack. (I ordered a box on eBay, so they just pull from there). I am currently the world champion (ExplOrozcos League) and Jonas is currently the 1v1v1 champion. We might start ordering specific cards in order to really fancy up our decks.

The biggest problem is the little one. She is feral. She is the one with the most energy. Before this, she was in gymnastics once a week and we were thinking about upping that to two times a week. The kids had a Spanish class they'd go to and while one was in class, the other two would play in the nearby park. We're still trying to figure out something for her. It's really tough because the pollen is really bad and the bugs are also starting to get really pushy.

That's our sit-rep for March. I'm really glad how lucky we've been through all this. I know it's not over yet, with the prediction of peak infection in two or three weeks. We'll just keep taking it one day at a time.
