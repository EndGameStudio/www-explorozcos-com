    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ciri received the call from Grandma a few days ago. Due to the nationwide shortage, Grandma wanted to help make masks and was checking if we had some tools she could borrow. Grandma ended up having enough equipment and supplies but Ciri decided to jump in and do her part as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly, our dining table was overtaken with fabric, scissors, wire, elastic material, sewing machines, a laminator, a Cricut Maker, lots of Apple computing power and coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/deo07tbou/image/upload/v1585247240/explorozcos/03-2020-making-masks-setup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids, with their curiosity that is so beautiful (well, &lt;em&gt;sometimes.&lt;/em&gt; Sometimes, Mom and Dad just need a break!) asked Mom what she was up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It quickly became a family effort: learning to use a sewing machine; learning to cut fabric, wire, and elastic; and learning to put it all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/deo07tbou/image/upload/v1585247070/explorozcos/03-25-2020-mask-making.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed for our way of life and although some of it might go back to normal one day, some of it will not. Yet, the kids, so far, have been robust and curious. Don&#39;t get me wrong! It isn&#39;t easy! They&#39;re still kids with lots of energy and short attention spans. But they&#39;re really trying - they &lt;strong&gt;care&lt;/strong&gt;. I can&#39;t ask for any better character trait in these kiddos than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we make masks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love sunsets. They just never seem to get old. I&#39;ve watched the sunset over the Pacific Ocean, flying tens of thousands of feet above the ground, through the mountains of Germany and throughout Europe, and back on the NC coast and over the Appalachian mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each one, every evening is magical and unique and beautiful.  Our days are numbered and I like to think that every day is an opportunity to experience the world and do good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s our goal, do good. One way we&#39;ve decided to do good is to do good by our children. We want to give them various experiences of the world; see things we didn&#39;t get the chance to see; meet people we didn&#39;t get the chance to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to travel the States, see it in all its glory, one state at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love journaling but to put that journal in a public space feels weird - like my view on the world is more important than yours. I don&#39;t like that. What I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; like, is sharing. I see this journal as a way to share ideas, thoughts, and opinions. You might not agree. You might find inspiration. You might find friendship. If you say &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; to any of the above, well, mission accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned as we push ourselves on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re doing our best to shelter in place during this epidemic. Luckily, we are mostly remote as it is anyway and we only go out for supplies and walks (while keeping within the CDC guidance of the 6 foot rule).&lt;/p&gt;</content>
